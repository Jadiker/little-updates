#Little Updates On Me

This is a very basic site meant for giving updates to my friends as to what's going on in my life.
Obviously, this is public, so I won't go very much into details, but feel free to message me personally, and I'll be happy to talk there.

I've realized that I mostly like hearing about my friends' lives when I talk to them, and I don't like talking about my life, so hopefully putting it into a website will help me talk a little bit more :)
Though I do keep a diary of sorts, this will also help keep track of things going on.

Finals are almost upon me. I taught someone how to play piano over this past week. (They only knew how to play guitar and wanted to learn how piano chords work.)
I might apply for this Ingenuity Awards thing, but I'm not sure if my current idea for Tech Relief (my "startup" in the works) is really all that cool. The deadline is within the next two days though so that will sort itself out. I may decide to pitch something cooler, like having bots that actually stop natural disasters in action.
Talk to me about relationship stuff.
My aunt and uncle are going to have a baby which is really exciting! :)
These past couple days I worked a lot on the Practical Theorem Prover, and got it to prove the isosceles triangle theorem which I'm pretty happy about.
Some questions on my mind:
- Why are protesters often times seen as second-class citizens? The rich / people with power don't protest. (Is this true?) Why not? Does this mean that we inherently see protesters as being less powerful / weak / not as important as others? Does this inherently invalidate part of the purpose of protesting?

Here's an email I sent to the e-sports club here:
> Hello,

> I know I haven't been very active in this community, like, at all, but I have some exciting news to share.

> As some of you may know, over the past year or so, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) has been working on a [bot that plays 5v5 DOTA](https://openai.com/five/), and just a couple days ago they [beat the world champions](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/13/18309459/openai-five-dota-2-finals-ai-bot-competition-og-e-sports-the-international-champion), OG. This is the first time that world champions of any e-sport have lost to an AI in a live-streamed game.

> From the [18th to the 21st](https://openai.com/blog/how-to-train-your-openai-five/), OpenAI will be letting anyone (as far as I can tell) play with or against their AIs.
> 
> I'm planning on playing a few games with friends, and just wanted to let you all know about this really cool opportunity.
> 
> They ask that people register [here](https://arena.openai.com/#/register) so that they know how many servers they need to have running their AI in each area.
> 
> Hopefully we can figure out a way to beat them!

> Best,

So yeah, that's a quick overview of some of the things going on in my life this week.
Hopefully this will work for me better than Snapchat for staying in touch with you all and letting you know what's going on with me.
